### Info

What is AQI?

Think of the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level

of air pollution and the greater the health concern. For example, an AQI value

of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.

  

For each pollutant an AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to an ambient air concentration that equals the

level of the short-term national ambient air quality standard for protection of public health. AQI values at or below 100

are generally thought of as satisfactory. When AQI values are above 100, air quality is unhealthy: at first for certain

sensitive groups of people, then for everyone as AQI values get higher.

  

The AQI is divided into six categories. Each category corresponds to a different level of health concern.

Each category also has a specific color. The color makes it easy for people to quickly determine whether air quality

is reaching unhealthy levels in their communities.

What are the levels of an AQI?

| COLOR | LEVEL | Value of Index |
| ------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| Green | Good | 0 to 50 |
| Yellow | Moderate | 51 to 100 |
| Orange | Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups | 101 to 150 |
| Red | Unhealthy | 101 to 150 |
| Purple | Very Unhealthy | 201 to 300 |
| Maroon | Hazardous | 301 and higher |
